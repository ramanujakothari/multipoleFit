# multipoleFit
This python code is written by Rahul Kothari and Prabhkar Tiwari and fits first few multipoles for a given healpy map.
The method can be extended to any order multipole. See Table https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_spherical_harmonics#Real_spherical_harmonics for more information. The python file also does mock simulations. Thus this python file generates Figure 4 and implements the math given in the appendix of 2208.14397.
